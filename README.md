# Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of survival for individuals aboard the Titanic using logistic regression, a popular machine learning method for binary classification tasks. The dataset contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived the disaster or not. 

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved trained models for future use or deployment.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The data underwent rigorous cleaning procedures to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Categorical variables were encoded, and numerical features were scaled for modeling purposes.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Logistic regression models were trained using the processed data. The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their predictive capability. Cross-validation techniques were employed to ensure robustness.

## Observations

One notable observation from the trained model is the prediction for an individual labeled as person 863, indicating survival with a 74% probability. This result underscores the predictive power of the logistic regression model developed in this project.

## Future Work

- Explore additional feature engineering techniques to potentially improve model performance.
- Experiment with other machine learning algorithms to compare performance.
- Deploy the trained model for real-time predictions or integrate it into a larger application.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
